## TrigID - Triangulation for Identity
---
### HOW IT WORKS
TrigID uses a novel scheme, inspired by geometric triangulation. It takes common identifiers, encrypts them, then reduces their information content to 20 or fewer bits. This “mashing algorithm” makes what we call “Identity Vectors” that are really just arcs or edges – lines that connects facts in a giant identity graph.  We refer to each arc as a "Mash".
